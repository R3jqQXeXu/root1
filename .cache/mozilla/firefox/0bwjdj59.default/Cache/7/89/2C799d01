  <summary>Allows quick enable and disable of Java, Javascript, Cookies, Image Animations, Flash, Silverlight, Images, Stylesheets and Proxy from the Toolbar.  This is great for increasing security or decreasing bandwidth.</summary>
  <description>Easily turn on or off  Java, Javascript, Cookies, Animated Images, Flash, Silverlight, Stylesheets, Proxy and Automatic loading of images from the Toolbar without having to open the Options or Plugins dialog!  This is great for users that want a easy control over their bandwidth usage, privacy or general browsing security by blocking scripts, cookies or other functionality.  (FF29 removes the Status bar from the bottom, visit &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/212dc9a1dadbde3d5fd7f41a48ee67d4fad14c1a9f356ebbac5c13ed9ebe70fb/http%3A//quickjavaplugin.blogspot.com/2014/04/missing-your-addon-bar.html&#34;&gt;http://quickjavaplugin.blogspot.com/2014/04/missing-your-addon-bar.html&lt;/a&gt; for more information)

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE DESCRIPTION AND DEVELOPER COMMENTS BEFORE REPORTING A BUG!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Usage:
Install the extension and restart your browser to get the QJ Toolbar icons.  Configure the options by right clicking on any visible icon and selecting &#34;Options&#34;.  Customize the toolbar with which buttons you choose and enjoy.  It&#39;s that simple!  There are way more options to play with, for help with those right click any visible icon and select &#34;Help and FAQ&#34;.

(Note, if you don&#39;t know how to customize the toolbar icons google it)

Also please note that the scope of this extension is NOT as extensive as NoScript, and was not designed to compete with it.  This includes whitelisting/blacklisting sites and remembering their settings!  If you like NoScript then that&#39;s fine and this may not be the extension for you.  However this extension is ideal for those who prefer a simpler to use, less invasive interface while still having easier access to the controls.

If you have problems with it working or have any other comments or suggestions, please visit the support homepage for this extension at: &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/98bbccf644b59f8e8e9fc8e611f6336eadeed76162fefc63d23d4a37f443961f/http%3A//quickjavaplugin.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;http://quickjavaplugin.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;I take great pride in the rating of my extension. Please do not use the rating system as a bug reporting system or a feature request system as that is not it&#39;s purpose. If you enjoy and use my extension, please provide an appropriate rating, a contribution or both :) Thanks!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</description><license>
